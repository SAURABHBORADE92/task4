Imagine you open a website with a list of books and manually copy down each book’s name, price, star rating, whether it’s available, and the link to buy it.
This code does exactly that — but automatically:

It visits the first page of the Books to Scrape site.

It looks through the page’s structure to find where each book’s details are stored.

It collects all the details (title, price, rating, availability, link) for every book.

It writes them neatly in your terminal so you can see them instantly without opening the browser.

Final outcome: You get a neat, computer-generated “report” of every book on the first page of the website, all without manually copying anything.
